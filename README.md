# ブルーベリー (burūberī)

Less flaky Bluetooth Low Energy for Android.

# Introduction

Working with Bluetooth Low Energy on Android can be a real pain. Major quality
differences between manufacturers, mysterious undocumented error codes, bugs
introduced between OS releases... These are not the things dreams are made of.
Buruberi is a small library that wraps the Android Bluetooth Low Energy APIs,
and tries to insulate you from as many of these problems as it can. When it
can't insulate you from a problem, it does its best to provide mitigation tools.

# TODO

- Clean up implementation of characteristic writes.
- Clean up implementation of descriptor notification control.
- Sort out generating jars for distribution.
- Sort out maven hosting.
